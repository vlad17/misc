Hacked-together scripts for doing remote builds on colo machines.
==========

This can be handy if you want to run your build on beefier hardware,
or just run a clean build without monopolizing all the cores on
your poor laptop.

Usage:

On the build box:
  remote-build/init-build-dir.sh /data/1/todd/autotest-repo

On your own box:
  cd ~/git/kudu
  git config remote-build.url ssh://yourbox.halxg.cloudera.com/data/1/todd/autotest-repo
  remote-build.sh

Tips:

- The build will run with the current state of your git repo, including staged
  and unstaged changes. However, it will not run against any files which are
  not tracked by git, so if you want to run tests including new files, make sure
  you 'git add' them first.

- There are some flags which can be passed to remote-build.sh. Look at the source
  for documentation. Feel free to add more and submit a pull request.

- For best performance you probably want to put your autotest repo on a local disk
  and not NFS.
